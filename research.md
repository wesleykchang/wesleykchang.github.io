Below is a glimpse of some recent projects:

## **High resolution acoustic imaging**
X-ray techniques benefit from high spatial resolution imaging. Ultrasound benefits from fast temporal resolution along with direct measurements of mechanical properties (i.e. modulus and density). In combination with stepper motors, a commercial pouch cell can be fully imaged in minutes with < 0.5 mm spatial resolution. As a result, operando acoustic imaging of Li plating and/or gassing during fast-charging of commercial Li-ion batteries is possible.

The figure below depicts an experiment that captured battery stiffness, expansion, and sound speed during cycling, using a combination of ultrasound transducers within a transmission x-ray microscope.

## **Measuring rate of cell gassing with acoustics**
High temperature environments can lead to gas building up in a cell because of electrolyte decomposition reactions. In pouch form, this leads to significant bulging of the cell. In cylindrical cells, this is why safety vents are engineered to the design in order to prevent catastrophic explosions. Solid/gas interfaces are nearly completely attenuating to sound, which makes gassing occurrence easily detectable with acoustics. In fact, moving the cell from a low to high temperature has beeen shown to cause significant gassing, even in the absence of cycling. This work was published in the JES Focus Issue (2020) on Battery Safety, Reliability and Mitigation. The figure below shows that the loss of sound signal occurred faster when transitioned to higher temperature environments due to faster degradaton kinetics.

## **Acoustic detection of Li plating in commercial Li-ion batteries**
Lithium metal plating on the graphite negative electrode is a major concern if a lithium-ion battery is fast-charged. Li-ion batteries are typically rated up to around 1C (e.g. at a rate equivalent to a full charge in 60 minutes), but equivalent charge times comparable with combustion engine gas re-filling would require around 15 minutes, or a 4C charge rate. Such high charge rates severely limit transport at the particle scale in the battery and may lead to significant diffusion gradients that cause lithium to plate as metal rather than insert, or intercalate, into the graphite particles. Plated lithium metal can then lead to other side-reactions and electrolyte decomposition, hence limiting the performance and cycle life of the battery. In the [Cell Reports Phys Sci paper](https://wesleykchang.github.io/publications/2020_Cell_Reports.pdf), I presented a large dataset that demonstrates the ability of acoustics to detect and estimate the degree of lithium metal plating during cycling. Since plated lithium metal affects the overall mechanical properties of the battery (e.g. by increasing the total thickness and decreasing the modulus), the sound speed and attenuation are both affected. These changes in sound properties are correlated with the amount of lithium plating.

## **Failure modes of columnar lithium morphology**
The formation of the solid-electrolyte-interphase (SEI) on lithium metal is a highly complex cascade of chemical reactions. In conventional LiPF<sub>6</sub>-based electrolytes, common compositions include LiF, lithium oxides, and lithium carbonates along with other alkyl carbonates. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy mapping can map out spatial heterogeneities in various components of the SEI and determine how they change with different types of morphologies. Using XPS mapping, I showed that the loss of dense/columnar morphology is associated with higher relative compositions of Li<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> rather than Li<sub>2</sub>O and also less LiF in conventional carbonate solvent. However, adding fluorinated carbonate (FEC) does not show the same chemical decomposition pathways - the loss of morphology does not substantially affect the SEI composition pointing to the enhanced chemical stability despite continued lack of mechanical integrity.

## **Impact of the copper current collector surface on lithium deposition morphology**
Seemingly the least important part of a battery, we showed here that even small changes to how the copper metal surface is cleaned/polished significantly affects the resulting surface reaction upon exposure to lithium electrolytes, and also affects the resulting lithium deposition morphology. A dense, columnar morphology is obtained if the surface oxide is removed but some trace water is kept in order to induce a hydrolysis reaction with LiPF<sub>6</sub> to form a LiF-rich interphase.
