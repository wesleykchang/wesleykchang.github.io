### About Me
Wesley Chang is a PhD candidate at Princeton University working jointly in the [Andlinger Center for Energy and the Environment](https://acee.princeton.edu/), and since May 2019, the [Columbia University Electrochemical Energy Center](https://ceec.engineering.columbia.edu/). He is advised by [Dr. Daniel Steingart](https://dansteingart.com/), researching electrode/electrolyte interfacial phenomena in lithium-ion and lithium metal batteries. Specifically, he is interested in exploring the interconnection between chemical and mechanical properties of the electrode/electrolyte interface, utilizing advanced characterization techniques such as x-ray spectroscopy and operando acoustic diagnostics. 
 
He is a 2014 graduate of Stanford University where he studied chemical engineering with an emphasis on materials science. After thinking of himself as a chemical engineer (briefly, nanomaterials research, grid-scale batteries, and semiconductor processing), and then in technology and management consulting, his interests centered in on next-generation battery research. On this topic, he has previously worked on various forms of new battery technologies, ranging from the electrochemical properties of [carbon nanotube-based hybrid nanomaterials](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2012/06/120626114316.htm), silicon microparticles as low-cost high-energy-density anodes for Li-ion batteries, and commercial-scale [zinc-bromine flow batteries](https://www.primuspower.com/en/) for grid storage. 
 
Besides tinkering in the lab and thinking about how batteries can work better, he enjoys cooking up delicious dinner recipes, rural exploration via hiking mountains domestically and internationally (favorites in no particular order: Grand Tetons, Yosemite, Zion, Grand Canyon, Japan Alps and Mt Fuji, Picos de Europa in Spain), and fully immersing himself in the cultural melting pot of New York City, where he currently resides. He is an advocate for increased inclusion and diversity in STEM at the graduate level. Having received the prestigious [Questbridge Match full-ride scholarship](https://www.questbridge.org/about/mission-and-vision) for his undergraduate studies at Stanford, he has been involved in various opportunities to give back to the community. As a graduate student at Princeton, he has participated as a Graduate Fellow advising first-gen low-income undergraduate students on STEM careers and graduate programs through the [Scholars Institute Fellows Program](https://sifp.princeton.edu/our-mission), and plans to continue leading these important efforts at the graduate level and beyond.
