### About Wesley
Wesley Chang is a PhD candidate at Princeton University working jointly in the [Andlinger Center for Energy and the Environment](https://acee.princeton.edu/), and since May 2019, the [Columbia Electrochemical Energy Center](https://ceec.engineering.columbia.edu/). He is advised by [Dr. Daniel Steingart](https://dansteingart.com/), researching the chemo-mechanics of lithium-ion and lithium metal batteries, and closely collaborates with other battery researchers at US Department of Energy National Labs and both Princeton and Columbia. 
 
He is a 2014 graduate of Stanford University where he studied chemical engineering and materials science. A deep fundamental understanding of battery and energy storage technologies requires state-of-the-art multimodal characterization techniques at all length scales to bring together the physical chemistry, thermodynamics, electrochemistry, and mechanics of new energy storage materials. This is what will enable practical energy storage material designs and technologies, which may lead to the building of a post-scarcity civilization.  
 
Besides tinkering in the lab, he enjoys mountain hiking and snowboarding throughout the Western US, and fully immersing himself in the cultural melting pot of New York City, where he currently resides. Having received the [Questbridge Match full-ride scholarship](https://www.questbridge.org/about/mission-and-vision) for his undergraduate studies at Stanford, he has continued to advocate for increased inclusion and diversity in STEM as a Princeton Graduate Fellow [(Scholars Institute Fellows Program)](https://sifp.princeton.edu/our-mission), advising first-gen low-income undergraduate students on STEM careers.
