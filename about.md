### About Wesley
I'm a PhD candidate at Princeton University working jointly in the [Andlinger Center for Energy and the Environment](https://acee.princeton.edu/), and since May 2019, the [Columbia Electrochemical Energy Center](https://ceec.engineering.columbia.edu/). I'm advised by [Dr. Daniel Steingart](https://steingart.engineering.columbia.edu/), and I primarily work on understanding the electro-chemical-mechanical coupling of lithium-ion and lithium-metal batteries. I've spent time elucidating fast-charge degradation mechanisms, exploring current collector effects for "anode-free" systems, and developing an operando acoustic imaging technique. 

Before graduate school, I worked on [grid-scale storage batteries](https://www.primuspower.com/en/) after receiving my Bachelor's and Master's in Chemical Engineering from Stanford University. My foray into various battery chemistries the past 10 years originated from the understanding that batteries hold the key to renewable energy storage. This is surely the case, and the massive scaleup of commercial battery manufacturing brings optimism. However, electrochemistry is important for not just energy storage but also conversion, and may be a promising alternative synthesis route for renewable fuel and materials (i.e. ammonia), an area which I have just recently begun to explore.  

Besides tinkering in the lab, I enjoy hiking, snowboarding, and exploring New York City where I currently live. Having received the [Questbridge Match full-ride scholarship](https://www.questbridge.org/about/mission-and-vision) for my undergraduate studies at Stanford, I've continued to advocate for increased inclusion and diversity in STEM as a Princeton Graduate Fellow [(Scholars Institute Fellows Program)](https://sifp.princeton.edu/our-mission), advising first-gen low-income undergraduate students on STEM careers.
