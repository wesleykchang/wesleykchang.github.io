### About Me
I think a lot about how we use, store and transport energy. I'm particularly interested in figuring out how lithium metal batteries can be commercialized, whether in the form of liquid or solid-state cells. My PhD thesis has spanned the following areas: interfaces and interphases for anode-free lithium metal cells, developing a new operando ultrasound characterization and imaging technique for batteries, and fast-charging and temperature-driven electrode phase behaviors. I'm advised by [Dr. Daniel Steingart](https://steingart.engineering.columbia.edu/) at [Princeton](https://acee.princeton.edu/) and partly at the [Columbia Electrochemical Energy Center](https://ceec.engineering.columbia.edu/). 

Before grad school, I worked on [grid-scale storage batteries](https://www.primuspower.com/en/) after receiving my Bachelor's and Master's in Chemical Engineering from Stanford. My exploration of various battery chemistries the past 10 years started from the belief that batteries hold the key to renewable energy storage - this is evidenced by the currently on-going massive scaleup of commercial battery manufacturing. Beyond batteries, I'm also quite interested in electrochemistry as a tool for synthesis of renewable fuels such as ammonia. 

Besides tinkering in the lab, I enjoy hiking, snowboarding, and exploring New York City where I currently live. Having received the [Questbridge Match full-ride scholarship](https://www.questbridge.org/about/mission-and-vision) for my undergraduate studies at Stanford, I've continued to advocate for increased inclusion and diversity in STEM as a Princeton Graduate Fellow [(Scholars Institute Fellows Program)](https://sifp.princeton.edu/our-mission), advising first-gen low-income undergraduate students on STEM careers.
