### About Wesley
I'm a PhD candidate at Princeton University working jointly in the [Andlinger Center for Energy and the Environment](https://acee.princeton.edu/), and since May 2019, the [Columbia Electrochemical Energy Center](https://ceec.engineering.columbia.edu/). I'm advised by [Dr. Daniel Steingart](https://steingart.engineering.columbia.edu/), and I research the chemo-mechanics of lithium-ion and lithium metal batteries. Part of my work involves collaboration with the [Arnold Lab](https://spikelab.mycpanel.princeton.edu/) on battery mechanics, the [Marbella Lab](https://www.marbella-lab.com/) on chemo-mechanics, and the [Sakamoto Lab](https://sakamoto.engin.umich.edu/people/) on solid-state batteries. 

Before graduate school, I worked on a zinc-based grid-storage battery at [Primus Power](https://www.primuspower.com/en/) after receiving my Bachelor's and Master's in Chemical Engineering from Stanford University. I'm broadly interested in energy storage technologies and specifically bridging the gap between interface chemistry and mechanics for lithium-ion and lithium metal batteries. This began from the understanding that batteries hold the key for enabling the shift to a clean energy society. A deep fundamental understanding of complex battery technologies requires state-of-the-art multimodal characterization techniques. 

Besides tinkering in the lab, I enjoy hiking, snowboarding, and exploring New York City where I currently live. Having received the [Questbridge Match full-ride scholarship](https://www.questbridge.org/about/mission-and-vision) for my undergraduate studies at Stanford, I've continued to advocate for increased inclusion and diversity in STEM as a Princeton Graduate Fellow [(Scholars Institute Fellows Program)](https://sifp.princeton.edu/our-mission), advising first-gen low-income undergraduate students on STEM careers.
