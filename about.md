### About Me
Wesley Chang is a PhD candidate at Princeton University working jointly in the [Andlinger Center for Energy and the Environment](https://acee.princeton.edu/), and since May 2019, the [Columbia University Electrochemical Energy Center](https://ceec.engineering.columbia.edu/). He is advised by [Dr. Daniel Steingart](https://dansteingart.com/), researching electrode/electrolyte interfacial phenomena in lithium-ion and lithium metal batteries, and closely collaborates with other battery researchers at DOE National Labs and both Princeton and Columbia. 
 
He is a 2014 graduate of Stanford University where he studied chemical engineering with an emphasis on materials science. After thinking of himself as a chemical engineer and a brief stint in technology and management consulting, his interests centered in on fundamental battery materials research. The transition to a post-scarcity society will be enabled by new materials designs, understanding, and deployment for fully renewable energy storage technologies. 
 
Besides tinkering in the lab, he enjoys mountain hiking and snowboarding throughout the Western US, and fully immersing himself in the cultural melting pot of New York City, where he currently resides. Having received the prestigious [Questbridge Match full-ride scholarship](https://www.questbridge.org/about/mission-and-vision) for his undergraduate studies at Stanford, he has continued to advocate for increased inclusion and diversity in STEM at the graduate level. He has participated as a Princeton Graduate Fellow [(Scholars Institute Fellows Program)](https://sifp.princeton.edu/our-mission), advising first-gen low-income undergraduate students on STEM careers and graduate programs, and plans to continue leading these important efforts beyond the graduate level.
