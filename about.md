### About Me
Wesley Chang is a PhD candidate at Princeton University working jointly in the [Andlinger Center for Energy and the Environment](https://acee.princeton.edu/), and since May 2019, the [Columbia University Electrochemical Energy Center](https://ceec.engineering.columbia.edu/). He is advised by [Dr. Daniel Steingart](https://dansteingart.com/), researching electrode/electrolyte interfacial phenomena in lithium-ion and lithium metal batteries, and closely collaborates with other battery researchers at DOE National Labs and both Princeton and Columbia. 
 
He is a 2014 graduate of Stanford University where he studied chemical engineering with an emphasis on materials science. After thinking of himself as a chemical engineer and then in technology and management consulting, his interests centered in on next-generation battery research. The transition to a post-scarcity society necessitates new materials understanding, design and deployment for renewable energy storage. 

On this topic, he has previously worked on various forms of new battery technologies, ranging from the electrochemical properties of [carbon nanotube-based hybrid nanomaterials](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2012/06/120626114316.htm), silicon microparticles as low-cost high-energy-density anodes for Li-ion batteries, and commercial-scale [zinc-bromine flow batteries](https://www.primuspower.com/en/) for grid storage. 
 
Besides tinkering in the lab, he enjoys mountain hiking and snowboarding throughout the Western US, and fully immersing himself in the cultural melting pot of New York City, where he currently resides. Having received the prestigious [Questbridge Match full-ride scholarship](https://www.questbridge.org/about/mission-and-vision) for his undergraduate studies at Stanford, he has continued to advocate for increased inclusion and diversity in STEM at the graduate level. At Princeton, he has participated as a Graduate Fellow advising first-gen low-income undergraduate students on STEM careers and graduate programs through the [Scholars Institute Fellows Program](https://sifp.princeton.edu/our-mission), and plans to continue leading these important efforts at the graduate level and beyond.
