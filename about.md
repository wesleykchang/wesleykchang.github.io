### About Wesley
I'm a PhD candidate at Princeton University working jointly in the [Andlinger Center](https://acee.princeton.edu/), and since May 2019, the [Columbia Electrochemical Energy Center](https://ceec.engineering.columbia.edu/). I'm advised by [Dr. Daniel Steingart](https://steingart.engineering.columbia.edu/), and my research involves untangling the coupled electro-chemical-mechanical behaviors of lithium-ion and lithium metal batteries. This spans the following areas: operando acoustic characterization and imaging, interfaces and interphases for anode-free lithium metal cells, fast-charging and temperature-driven cell behavior. 

Before graduate school, I worked on [grid-scale storage batteries](https://www.primuspower.com/en/) after receiving my Bachelor's and Master's in Chemical Engineering from Stanford University. My foray into various battery chemistries the past 10 years originated from the understanding that batteries hold the key to renewable energy storage - this is evidenced by the currently on-going massive scaleup of commercial battery manufacturing. 

Electrochemistry, however, is important for not just energy storage but also energy conversion, and may be a promising alternative synthesis route for renewable fuels such as ammonia, an area which I have just recently begun to explore.  

Besides tinkering in the lab, I enjoy hiking, snowboarding, and exploring New York City where I currently live. Having received the [Questbridge Match full-ride scholarship](https://www.questbridge.org/about/mission-and-vision) for my undergraduate studies at Stanford, I've continued to advocate for increased inclusion and diversity in STEM as a Princeton Graduate Fellow [(Scholars Institute Fellows Program)](https://sifp.princeton.edu/our-mission), advising first-gen low-income undergraduate students on STEM careers.
